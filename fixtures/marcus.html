<li><b>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil.</b> (Hays translation)</li>
<li>Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today inquisitive, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill.

<li>II, 1</li>

</li>


<li>γεγόναμεν γὰρ πρὸς συνεργίαν ὡς πόδες, ὡς χεῖρες, ὡς βλέφαρα, ὡς οἱ στοῖχοι τῶν ἄνω καὶ κάτω ὀδόντων. τὸ οὖν ἀντιπράσσειν ἀλλήλοις παρὰ φύσιν.

<li>We are all made for mutual assistance, as the feet, the hands, and the eyelids, as the rows of the upper and under teeth, from whence it follows that clashing and opposition is perfectly unnatural.

<li>II, 1</li>

</li>

</li>


<li>Whatever this is that I am, it is flesh and a little spirit and an intelligence. (Hays translation)

<li>This that I am, whatever it be, is mere flesh and a little breathe and the ruling Reason (Haines translation)</li>
<li>This Being of mine, whatever it really is, consists of a little flesh, a little breath, and the part which governs.</li>
<li>A little flesh, a little breath, and a Reason to rule all – that is myself.</li>
<li>II, 2</li>

</li>


<li>What is divine is full of Providence. Even chance is not divorced from nature, from the inweaving and enfolding of things governed by Providence. Everything proceeds from it. (Hays translation)

<li>All that is from the gods is full of Providence.</li>

<li>There is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and never return. (Hays translation)

<li>Yes, you can--if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. (Hays translation)

<li>You will find rest from vain fancies if you perform every act in life as though it were your last.</li>
<li>II, 5</li>

</li>


<li>You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that's all even the gods can ask of you. (Hays translation)

<li>Thou seest how few be the things, the which if a man has at his command his life flows gently on and is divine.</li>

<li>Τούτων ἀεὶ μεμνῆσθαι, τίς ἡ τῶν ὅλων φύσις</li>
<li>II, 9</li>

</li>


<li>Yet living and dying, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, riches and poverty, and so forth are equally the lot of good men and bad. Things like these neither elevate nor degrade; and therefore they are no more good than they are evil.

<li>II, 11</li>

</li>


<li>The longest-lived and the shortest-lived man, when they come to die, lose one and the same thing.

<li><b>Remember that all is opinion.</b>

<li>Ὅτι πᾶν ὑπόληψις.</li>
<li>II, 15</li>

</li>


<li>No state sorrier than that of the man who keeps up a continual round, and pries into "the secrets of the nether world," as saith the poet, and is curious in conjecture of what is in his neighbour's heart.

<li>II, 13</li>

</li>


<li>Though thou be destined to live three thousand years and as many myriads besides, yet remember that no man loseth other life than that which he liveth, nor liveth other than that which he loseth.

<li>II, 14</li>

</li>


<li>For a man can lose neither the past nor the future; for how can one take from him that which is not his? So remember these two points: first, that each thing is of like form from everlasting and comes round again in its cycle, and that it signifies not whether a man shall look upon the same things for a hundred years or two hundred, or for an infinity of time; second, that the longest lived and the shortest lived man, when they come to die, lose one and the same thing.

<li>II, 14</li>

</li>


<li>As for life, it is a battle and a sojourning in a strange land; but the fame that comes after is oblivion.

<li>You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they're really possessed by what they do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts. Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort? (Hays translation)

<li>V, 1</li>

</li>


<li>How easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which is troublesome or unsuitable, and immediately to be in all tranquility.

<li>To shrug it all off and wipe it clean--every annoyance and distraction--and reach utter stillness. Child's play. (Hays translation)</li>
<li>V, 2</li>

</li>


<li>Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren't, but they're still aware of it--still regard it as a debt. But others don't even do that. They're like a vine that produces grapes without looking for anything in return. (Hays translation)

<li>A man makes no noise over a good deed, but passes on to another as a vine to bear grapes again in season.</li>
<li>V, 6</li>

<li>A horse at the end of the race...A dog when the hunt is over...A bee with its honey stored...And a human being after helping others. They don't make a fuss about it. They just go on to something else, as the vine looks forward to bearing fruit again in season. We should be like that. Acting almost unconsciously. (Hays translation)

<li>V, 6</li>

</li>


<li>The other reason is that what happens to the individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world--of its well-being, its fulfillment, or its very existence, even. Because the whole is damaged if you cut away anything--anything at all--from its continuity and its coherence. Not only its parts, but its purposes. And that's what you're doing when you complain: hacking and destroying. (Hays translation)

<li>V, 7</li>

</li>


<li>Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren't packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human--however imperfectly--and fully embrace the pursuit that you've embarked on. (Hays translation)

<li>Flinch not, neither give up nor despair, if the achieving of every act in accordance with right principle is not always continuous with thee.</li>

<li>V, 18</li>

</li>


<li>Things have no hold on the soul. They have no access to it, cannot move or direct it. It is moved and directed by itself alone. It takes the things before it and interprets them as it sees fit. (Hays translation)

<li>V, 19</li>

</li>


<li>In a sense, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them. But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us--like sun, wind, and animals. Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. (Hays translation)

<li>V.20</li>

</li>


<li>Prize that which is best in the universe; and this is that which useth everything and ordereth everything.

<li>V, 21</li>

</li>


<li>The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh--gentle and violent ones alike. Not mingling with them, but fencing itself off and keeping those feelings in their place. When they make their way into our thoughts, through the sympathetic link between mind and body, don't try to resist the sensation. The sensation is natural. But don't let the mind start in with judgments, calling it 'good' or 'bad.' (Hays translation)

<li>Ὅρα μὴ ἀποκαισαρωθῇς, μὴ βαφῇς· γίνεται γάρ. τήρησον οὖν σεαυτὸν ἁπλοῦν, ἀγαθόν, ἀκέραιον, σεμνόν, ἄκομψον, τοῦ δικαίου φίλον, θεοσεβῆ, εὐμενῆ, φιλόστοργον, ἐρρωμένον πρὸς τὰ πρέποντα ἔργα. ἀγώνισαι, ἵνα τοιοῦτος συμμείνῃς, οἷόν σε ἠθέλησε ποιῆσαι φιλοσοφία. αἰδοῦ θεούς, σῷζε ἀνθρώπους. βραχὺς ὁ βίος· εἷς καρπὸς τῆς ἐπιγείου ζωῆς, διάθεσις ὁσία καὶ πράξεις κοινωνικαί.

<li><b>Take heed not to be transformed into a Caesar, not to be dipped in the purple dye, for it does happen. Keep yourself therefore, simple, good, pure, grave, unaffected, the friend of justice, religious, kind, affectionate, strong for your proper work. Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you. Reverence the gods, save men. Life is brief; there is but one harvest of earthly existence, a holy disposition and neighborly acts.</b></li>

<li>Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but of the things which thou hast, select the best, and then reflect how eagerly they would have been sought, if thou hadst them not. At the same time, however, take care that thou dost not, through being so pleased with them, accustom thyself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if ever thou shouldst not have them.

<li>Suppose that men kill thee, cut thee in pieces, curse thee. What then can these things do to prevent thy mind from remaining pure, wise, sober, just?

<li>The nature of the universe is the nature of things that are. Now, things that are have kinship with things that are from the beginning. Further, this nature is styled Truth; and it is the first cause of all that is true.

<li>He would be the finer gentleman that should leave the world without having tasted of lying or pretence of any sort, or of wantonness or conceit.

<li>Think not disdainfully of death, but look on it with favor; for even death is one of the things that Nature wills.

<li><b>A wrongdoer is often a man who has left something undone, not always one who has done something.</b>

<li>Ἀδικεῖ πολλάκις ὁ μὴ ποιῶν τι, οὐ μόνον ὁ ποιῶν τι.</li>
<li>IX, 5</li>

</li>


<li>Blot out vain pomp; check impulse; quench appetite; keep reason under its own control.

<li>IX, 7</li>

</li>


<li>Things that have a common quality ever quickly seek their kind.

<li>IX, 9</li>

</li>


<li>All things are the same,—familiar in enterprise, momentary in endurance, coarse in substance. All things now are as they were in the day of those whom we have buried.

<li>IX, 14</li>

</li>


<li>The happiness and unhappiness of the rational, social animal depends not on what he feels but on what he does; just as his virtue and vice consist not in feeling but in doing.

<li>IX, 16</li>

</li>


<li>All things are changing; and thou thyself art in continuous mutation and in a manner in continuous destruction and the whole universe to.

<li>IX, 19</li>

</li>


<li><b>Turn thy thoughts now to the consideration of thy life, thy life as a child, as a youth, thy manhood, thy old age, for in these also every change was a death. Is this anything to fear?</b>

<li>IX, 21</li>

</li>


<li>Hasten [to examine] thy own ruling faculty and that of the universe and that of thy neighbor: thy own, that thy may make it just; and that of the universe, that thou mayst remember of what thou art a part; and that of thy neighbor, that thy mayst know whether he has acted ignorantly or with knowledge, and that thou mayst also consider that his ruling faculty is akin to thine.

<li>IX, 22</li>

</li>


<li>As thou thyself art a component part of a social system, so let every act of thine be a component part of social life. <b>Whatever act of thine that has no reference</b>, either immediately or remotely, <b>to a social end, this</b> tears asunder thy life, and does not allow it to be one, and it <b>is of the nature of a mutiny</b>, just as when in a popular assembly a man acting by himself stands apart from the general agreement.

<li>IX, 23</li>

</li>


<li>The universal intelligence puts itself in motion for every separate effect... or it puts itself in motion once, and everything else comes by way of a sequence in a manner; or individual elements are the origin of all things. In a word, <b>if there is a god, all is well; and if chance rules, do not thou be governed by it</b>.

<li>IX, 28</li>

</li>


<li>If man reflects on the changes and transformations which follow one another like wave after wave and their rapidity, he will despise everything which is perishable.

<li>IX, 28</li>

</li>


<li>Do what nature now requires. Set thyself in motion, if it is in thy power, and do not look about thee to see if any one will observe it; nor yet expect <a href="/wiki/Plato#The_Republic" title="Plato">Plato's Republic</a>: but be content if the smallest thing goes on well, and consider such an event to be no small matter.

<li>Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note it…. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.</li>
<li>IX, 29</li>

</li>


<li><b>Let there be freedom from perturbations with respect to the things which come from the external cause; and let there be justice in the things done by virtue of the internal cause</b>, that is, let there be movement and action <b>terminating in</b> this, in <b>social acts</b>, for this is according to thy nature.

<li>IX, 31</li>

</li>


<li>He that dies in extreme old age will be reduced to the same state with him that is cut down untimely.

<li>IX, 33</li>

</li>


<li>The rottenness of the matter which is the foundation of everything!

<li>IX, 36</li>

</li>


<li>Either all things proceed from one intelligent source and come together as in one body, and the part ought not to find fault with what is done for the benefit of the whole; or there are only atoms, and nothing else than a mixture and dispersion. Why, then, art thou disturbed? Say to this ruling faculty, Art thou dead, art thou corrupted, art thou playing the hypocrite, art thou become a beast, dost thou herd and feed with the rest?

<li>IX, 39</li>

</li>


<li><b>Why dost thou not pray... to give thee the faculty of not fearing any of the things which thou fearest, or of not desiring any of the things which thou desirest</b>, or not being pained at anything, <b>rather than pray that any of these things should not happen or happen?</b>

<li>IX, 40</li>

</li>


<li><b>Is it not better to use what is in thy power</b> like a free man <b>than to desire</b> in a slavish and abject way <b>what is not in thy power?</b>

<li>IX, 40</li>

</li>


<li>One man prays thus: How shall I be able to lie with that woman? Do thou pray thus: How shall I not desire to lie with her? Another prays: How shall I be released from this? Another prays: How shall I not desire to be released? Another thus: How shall I not lose my little son? Thou thus: How shall I not be afraid to lose him? In fine, turn thy prayers this way, and see what comes.

<li>IX, 40</li>

</li>


<li>Art thy not content that thou hast done something conformable to thy nature, and dost thou seek to be paid for it? Just as if the eye demanded recompense for seeing, or the feet for walking. For as these members are formed for a particular purpose... so also is man formed by nature to acts of benevolence.

<li>Wilt thou then, my soul, never be good and simple and one and naked, more manifest than the body which surrounds thee? Wilt thou never enjoy an affectionate and contented disposition? Wilt thou never be full and without a want of any kind, longing for nothing more, nor desiring anything, either animate of inanimate, for the enjoyment of pleasures? nor yet desiring time wherein thou shalt have longer enjoyment, or place, or pleasant climate, or society of men with whom thou mayst live in harmony? but wilt thou be satisfied with thy present condition, and pleased with all that is around thee, and wilt thou convince thyself that thou hast everything and that it comes from the gods, that everything is well for thee, and will be well whatever shall please them, and whatever they shall give for the conservation of the perfect living being, the good and just and beautiful, which generates and holds together all things, and contains and embraces all things which are dissolved for the production of other like things? Wilt thou never be such that thou shalt so dwell in community with gods and men as neither to find fault with them at all, nor to be condemned by them?

<li>X, 1</li>

</li>


<li>Use these rules then, and trouble thyself about nothing else.

<li>X, 2</li>

</li>


<li>If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error. But if thou art not able, blame thyself, or blame not even thyself.

<li>X, 4</li>

</li>


<li>Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all eternity; and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread of thy being, and of that which is incident to it.

<li>X, 5</li>

<li><b>The whole contains nothing which is not or its advantage; and all natures indeed have this common principle, but the nature of the universe has this principle besides, that it cannot be compelled even by any external cause to generate anything harmful to itself.</b>

<li>X, 6</li>

</li>


<li><b>By remembering</b> then <b>that I am a part of such a whole</b>, I shall be content with everything that happens. <b>And inasmuch as I am in a manner intimately related to the parts which are of the same kind with myself, I shall do nothing unsocial</b>, but I shall rather direct myself to the things which are of the same kind with myself, <b>and I shall turn all my efforts to the common interest</b>, and divert them from the contrary.

<li>X, 6</li>

</li>


<li>Remember that the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality" class="extiw" title="w:Rationality">Rational</a> was intended to signify a <b>discriminating attention to every</b> several <b>thing and freedom from negligence</b>; and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity" class="extiw" title="w:Equanimity">Equanimity</a> is the <b>voluntary acceptance of things which are assigned to thee by the common nature</b>; and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnanimity" class="extiw" title="w:Magnanimity">Magnanimity</a> is the <b>elevation of the intelligent part above the pleasurable or painful sensations</b> of the flesh, and <b>above</b> that poor thing called <b>fame, and death, and all such things.

<li>X, 8</li>

</li>


<li><b>Rememberest the gods</b>, and that they wish not to be flattered, but <b>wish all reasonable beings to be made like themselves</b>; and... rememberest that what does the work of a fig-tree is a fig-tree, and that what does the work of a dog is a dog, and that what does the work of a bee is a bee, and that what does the work of a man is a man.

<li>X, 8</li>

</li>


<li><b>Acquire the contemplative way of seeing how all things change into one another</b>, and constantly attend to it, and exercise thyself about this part [of philosophy]. <b>For nothing is so much adapted to produce magnanimity.</b> ...But as to what any man shall say or think about him, or do against him, he never even thinks of it, <b>being</b> himself <b>contented with these two things:</b> with <b>acting justly</b> in what he now does, <b>and being satisfied with what is now assigned to him</b>; and <b>he</b> lays aside all distracting and busy pursuits, and <b>desires nothing else than to accomplish the straight course through the law, and</b> by accomplishing the straight course <b>to follow God.</b>

<li>X, 11</li>

</li>


<li><b>What need is there of suspicious fear</b>, since it is in thy power to inquire what ought to be done? And if thy seest clear, go by this way content, without turning back: but if thy dost not see clear, stop and take the best advisers. But if any other things oppose thee, go on according to thy powers with due consideration, keeping to that which appears to be just. For it is best to reach this object, and if thou dost fail, let thy failure be in attempting this. <b>He who follows reason in all things is both tranquil and active at the same time, and also cheerful and collected.</b>

<li><b>Let this always be plain to thee, that this piece of land is like any other; and that all things here are the same with all things on the top of a mountain, or on the sea-shore, or wherever thou chooses to be.</b> For thou wilt find just what <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> says, Dwelling within the walls of the city as in a shepherd's fold on a mountain.

</li>


<li><b>What is my ruling faculty now to me?</b> and <b>of what nature am I now making it?</b> and <b>for what purpose am I now using it?</b> is it void of understanding? is it loosed and rent asunder from social life? is it melted and mixed with the poor flesh so as to move together with it?

<li>X, 24</li>

</li>


<li><b>He who flies from his master is a runaway; but the law is master</b>, and he who breaks the law is a runaway. And he also who is grieved or angry or afraid, is dissatisfied because something has been or is or shall be of the <b>things</b> which <b>are appointed by Him who rules all things, and He is Law, and assigns to every man what is fit.

<li><b>All those</b> [events in history] <b>were such dramas as we see now, only with different actors.</b>

<li><b>Only to the rational animal is it given to follow voluntarily</b> what happens; but <b>simply to follow is a necessity imposed on all.</b>

<li>X, 28</li>

</li>


<li><b>When thou art offended at any man's fault, forthwith turn to thyself and reflect in what manner thou doest error thyself... For</b> by attending to this thou wilt quickly forget thy anger, if this consideration is also added, that the <b>man is compelled</b>; for what else could he do? or, <b>if thou art able, take away from him the compulsion.</b>

<li>X, 30</li>

</li>


<li><b>Continuously thou wilt look at human things as smoke and nothing at all</b>; especially if thou reflectest at the same time, that what has once changed will never exist again in the infinite duration of time. But thou, in what a brief space of time is thy existence? <b>And why art thou not content to pass through this short time in an orderly way?</b>

<li>X, 31</li>

</li>


<li>What matter and opportunity [for thy activity] art thou avoiding? <b>For what else are all these things, except exercises for the reason</b>, when it has viewed carefully and by examination into their nature the things which happen in life? <b>Persevere then until thou shalt have made these things thy own</b>, as the stomach which is strengthened makes all things its own, <b>as the blazing fire makes flame and brightness out of everything that is thrown into it.</b>

<li>X, 31</li>

</li>


<li><b>Let it not be in any man's power to say truly of thee that thou art not simple or that thou art not good; but let him be a liar whoever shall think anything of this kind about thee; and this is altogether in thy power.</b>

<li>X, 32</li>

</li>


<li><b>It is not given to a cylinder to move everywhere by its own motion,</b> nor yet to water nor to fire <b>nor to anything else which is governed by nature or an irrational soul</b>, for the things which check them and stand in the way are many. <b>But intelligence and reason are able to go through everything that opposes them</b>, and in such manner as they are formed by nature and as they choose. Place before thy eyes this facility with which the reason will be carried through all things, <b>as fire upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder down an inclined surface</b>, and <b>seek for nothing further. For all</b> other <b>obstacles either affect the body only, which is a dead thing; or, except for opinion and the yielding of reason itself, they do not crush nor do any harm of any kind</b>; for if they did, he who felt it would immediately become bad.

<li>X, 33</li>

</li>


<li><b>In the case of all things which have a certain constitution, whatever harm</b> may happen to any of them, that which <b>is affected becomes consequently worse; but in like case, a man becomes both better... and more worthy of praise, by making the right use of these accidents.</b>

<li>X, 33</li>

</li>


<li>And finally remember that <b>nothing harms him who is really a citizen, which does not harm the state; nor yet does anything harm the state which does not harm law [order]; and of these things which are called misfortunes not one harms law. What then does not harm law does not harm either state or citizen.</b>

<li>X, 33</li>

</li>


<li>"Leaves, some the wind scatters on the ground—So is the race of man." <b>Leaves</b>, also, are thy children; and leaves, too, <b>are they who cry out so if they are worthy of credit, or bestow their praise, or</b> on the contrary <b>curse, or secretly blame and sneer; and</b> leaves, in like manner, are <b>those who shall receive and transmit a man's fame to after-times. For all such things as these "are produced in the season of spring,"</b> as the poet says; <b>then the wind casts them down; then the forest produces other leaves in their places.</b> But a brief existence is common to all things, <b>and yet thou avoidest and pursuest all things as if they would be eternal.</b>

<li>X, 34</li>

</li>


<li><b>A little time, and thou shalt close thy eyes; and him who has attended thee to thy grave, another soon will lament.</b>

<li>X, 34</li>

</li>


<li><b>The healthy eye ought to see all visible things and not to say, I wish for green things; for this is the condition of the diseased eye. And the healthy hearing and smelling ought to be ready to perceive all that can be heard and smelled. And the healthy stomach ought to be</b> with respect to all food just <b>as the mill with respect to all things which it is formed to grind. And accordingly the healthy understanding ought to be prepared for everything which happens</b>; but that which says, Let my dear children live, and let all men praise whatever I may do, is an eye which seeks for green things, or teeth which seek for soft things.

<li>X, 35</li>

</li>


<li><b>There is no man so fortunate that there shall not be by him when he is dying some who are pleased with what is going to happen.</b> Suppose that he was a good and a wise man, will there not be at least some one to say to himself, Let us at last breathe freely, being relieved from this schoolmaster? It is true that he was harsh to none of us, but I perceive that he tacitly condemns us.—This is what is said of a good man. But in our own case how many other things are there for which there are many who wish to get rid of us.

<li>X, 36</li>

</li>


<li><b>Remember that what pulls the strings is the force hidden within; there lies the power</b> to persuade, there <b>the life</b>,—there, if one must speak out, <b>the real man.</b>

<li>X, 38</li>

</li>


<li><b>In contemplating thyself never include the vessel</b> which surrounds thee, <b>and these instruments which are attached</b> about it. <b>For they are like an ax, differing only in</b> this, <b>that they grow to the body.</b> For indeed <b>there is no more use in these parts without the cause which moves and checks them than in the weaver's shuttle, and the writer's pen, and the driver's whip.</b>

<li>No form of Nature is inferior to Art; for the arts merely imitate natural forms.

<li>Everything is in a state of metamorphosis. Thou thyself art in everlasting change and in corruption to correspond; so is the whole universe.

<li>Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.

<li>No printed sources exist for this prior to 2009, and this seems to have been an attribution which arose on the internet, as indicated by web searches and rationales provided at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://threeshoutsonahilltop.blogspot.com/2011/06/marcus-aurelius-and-source-checking.html">"Marcus Aurelius and source checking" at <i>Three Shouts on a Hilltop</i> (14 June 2011)</a></li>
<li>This quote may be a paraphrase of "Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of Providence? But Gods there are, undoubtedly, and they regard human affairs; and have put it wholly in our power, that we should not fall into what is truly evil. " from <i>Meditations</i>, Book II, but the quote in question has a quite different meaning.</li>

</li>


<li>Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.

<li>Cited as being from The Meditations. This quote does not exist there; although there are several other statements about everything being an opinion, none of these are connected to a sentence about perspectives.</li>

<li><b>A man's greatness lies not in wealth and station, as the vulgar believe, not yet in his intellectual capacity, which is often associated with the meanest moral character, the most abject servility to those in high places and arrogance to the poor and lowly; but a man's true greatness lies in the consciousness of an honest purpose in life, founded on a just estimate of himself and everything else, on frequent self-examination, and a steady obedience to the rule which he knows to be right, without troubling himself, as the emperor</b> [Marcus Aurelius] <b>says he should not, about what others may think or say, or whether they do or do not do that which he thinks and says and does.</b>

<li>[W]e shall observe that Jewish intellectual qualities have remained constant, that certain characteristics, certain peculiar features of the Jewish soul may be traced as far back as the formation of the Jewish ethnical group. We cannot prove all this directly, because we have no reliable accounts of the Jewish popular character dating from early times. What we do possess are brief and scanty expressions of opinions, valuable, however, as far as they go. It is of great interest, for example, to note that the Pentateuch (in four places— Exod. xxxii. 9, xxxiv. 9; Deut. ix. 13 and 27) asserts of the Jews what <a href="/wiki/Tacitus" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> said of them later—that they are a stiff-necked people. No less interesting is <a href="/wiki/Cicero" title="Cicero">Cicero</a>’s statement that they hang together most fraternally, or Marcus Aurelius’s that they are a restless people, to whom he cries, “O ye Marcomanni, O ye Quadi, O ye Sarmatae, at length have I found a race more restless than you!”; or finally Juan de la Huarte’s that their intellect is keen and well fitted for worldly things. [...]<br />
Under the Caesars their lot [the Jews] was no different [than in other nations of antiquity]: “I am just sick of these filthy, noisy Jews,” said Marcus Aurelius.

<li>Hannibal Lecter: I've read the case files. Have you? Everything you need to find him is right there in those pages.<br />
Clarice Starling: Then tell me how.<br />
Hannibal Lecter: First principles, Clarice: simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius, "Of each particular thing, ask: What is it in itself? What is its nature?" What does he do, this man you seek?<br />
Clarice Starling: He kills women.<br />
Hannibal Lecter: No, that is incidental. What is the first and principal thing he does, what needs does he serve by killing?<br />
Clarice Starling: Anger, social acceptance, and, uh, sexual frustration …<br />
Hannibal Lecter: No, he <i>covets</i>. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer, now.<br />
Clarice Starling: No. We just …<br />
Hannibal Lecter: No. We begin by coveting what we see every day.

<li>Ted Tally (1991), <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> screenplay, adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris; Lecter is paraphrasing or quoting an alternate translation of <i>Meditations</i> Book VIII, 11: "This thing, what is it in itself, in its own constitution? What is its substance and material?" (George Long translation, 1862)</li>

<li>Marcus Aurelius was the perfect man, says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Renan" class="extiw" title="w:Ernest Renan">Renan</a>. Yes; the great emperor was a perfect man. But how intolerable were the endless claims upon him! He staggered under the burden of the empire. He was conscious how inadequate one man was to bear the weight of that Titan and too vast orb.

<li>Marcus Aurelius was the most modest, introspective and long-suffering of monarchs... [H]e was a good man and an enlightened ruler who wished only the best for his people. He had been carefully chosen and groomed for his job. Sickly and serious-minded as a child, he had developed (under the guidance of 25 distinguished tutors) into a dedicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" class="extiw" title="w:Stoicism">Stoic</a>, a practitioner of a philosophy that preached simplicity, self-discipline, endurance and duty.
